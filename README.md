# ACAIM

Here, is presented the training process of my impending to publish project/paper **Adaptive Content-Aware Influence Maximization through Online Stochastic Ranking** in the "IEEE Transactions on Knowledge and Data Engineering" - **TKDE** journal. In short, that project is mentioned as **ACAIM**, since it introduces and studies the novel ACAIM problem.

I stress that the input files that I provide here to run the training in ACAIM are tiny samples compared to the ones used in TKDE version. I just provide them here to show the flow of training and the format of input files. So, no efforts to understand the semantics of training output should be made on these tiny samples.
